# ‚ú® ReadMeGenius - AI README Generator ‚ú®

ReadMeGenius is a **Next.js** application that leverages **AI** (specifically **Genkit** with Google's Gemini models) to help users generate professional `README.md` files for their software projects. Users can input a GitHub repository URL, paste direct code snippets (from single or multiple files), or provide a textual prompt, and the AI will generate various sections of a README.

> **Core Functionality**: Generate comprehensive READMEs including project name, description, features, technologies used, setup instructions, and folder structure.

The application also features a theme toggle for light/dark mode preferences and allows users to save, view, download, and delete their generated READMEs using browser `localStorage` (user-specific). An authentication system (mock, `localStorage`-based) is included, requiring users to log in to access generation features. OTPs are "sent" via email using Nodemailer with Ethereal.email for testing.

## üìÇ Specialized Sections

The application offers distinct ways to generate READMEs, accessible through different parts of the UI:

### 1. Main README Generator (Homepage: `/`)
This is the primary interface for generating README files. It offers three input methods (<u>login required</u>):
*   **GitHub URL**: Provide a link to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Direct Code**: Paste one or more code snippets directly. Their combined content will be analyzed by the AI.
*   **From Prompt**: Describe your project in text, and the AI will craft a README.

Generated READMEs are automatically saved to the logged-in user's `localStorage` and can be managed in the "Saved READMEs" panel that appears on this page.

### 2. README from Past Link/Code (`/past`)
This section provides another instance of the main `ReadmeGenerator` component (<u>login required</u>). It's essentially an alternative access point to the same core generation functionalities available on the homepage, focused on using a GitHub URL or direct code pasting (single or multiple snippets) to generate a README. Saved READMEs here are also managed via the same user-specific `localStorage` as the homepage.

### 3. Past Files Inventory & Gen (`/past-files`)
This dedicated section (<u>login required</u>) allows users to:
1.  **Upload Multiple Files**: Users can select and upload multiple files from their local system.
2.  **View Uploaded Files**: A list of uploaded files (name and size) is displayed. Users can remove files from this list.
3.  **Generate Individual READMEs**: Clicking "Generate READMEs from Files" will trigger the AI to process *each uploaded file individually*. For every file, the AI will attempt to generate a full set of README sections (Project Name, Description, Features, etc.).
4.  **Display Generated READMEs**: Each generated README is displayed separately on the page, associated with its original filename.
5.  **Download Individual README.txt**: For each successfully generated README, a "Download README.txt" button allows users to download its content as a plain text file.

> This section is particularly useful when users want to generate distinct READMEs for several separate code files or modules from their local system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   ‚ö†Ô∏è You will need to add your **Google AI API Key** for Genkit to work:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
        ```
    *   Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   **OTP Email Sending (Optional for Local Development)**:
        This project uses `nodemailer` with `Ethereal.email` for testing OTP email sending. No specific environment variables are strictly required for Ethereal as it generates test accounts on the fly. When you sign up, the OTP and a link to preview the email on Ethereal will be logged to your **server console** (the terminal where you run `npm run dev`).
        
        If you wish to use your own SMTP provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) for sending OTP emails, you would typically set environment variables like:
        ```env
        # Example SMTP (e.g., for Gmail - ensure you have an App Password if using 2FA)
        # SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
        # SMTP_PORT=587
        # SMTP_SECURE=false # true for 465, false for other ports
        # SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
        # SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password 
        # SMTP_FROM_EMAIL="ReadMeGenius <no-reply@example.com>"
        ```
        And then modify `src/lib/email.ts` to use these variables instead of `nodemailer.createTestAccount()`.

4.  **Run the development server for Next.js**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
    When you sign up, check the **terminal running `npm run dev`** for the OTP and the Ethereal email preview link.

5.  **Run the Genkit development server** (<u>in a separate terminal</u>):
    This allows you to inspect and test your Genkit flows.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes:
    # npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit developer UI will typically be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
